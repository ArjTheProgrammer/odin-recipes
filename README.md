This is a tasked project from TOP (The Odin Project) a
road map to learn Web Development. I am currently at the
HTML module specifically in the Project:Recipes and following it's given task. I wanted to put
more design and effort but I am limited in time that I set 
doe myself to learn this skills. Besides, TOP stated that 
designing will be tackled in the CSS module.
