    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Lechon kawali or Pan-roasted pork to some is different from Lechon, the well known Filipino dish which is also the national dish of the Philippines. While lechon is cooked in a pit filled with flamed charcoal, Lechon kawali is cooked by boiling then later deep frying a portion of the pig (pork belly usually) .

        <p>
            Lechon kawali with a cup of rice please! This is my regular order at least once a week when I was in high school. Our school canteen serves one of the best versions of this dish. I like it best when the pork just got out of the pot. It is super crispy and hot.

    <h4>Recipes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs. pork belly</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole peppercorn</li>
            <li>5 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>3 cups cooking oil</li>
            <li>34 ounces water</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour water into a cooking pot and bring it to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the pork belly and 1 tablespoon of salt. Add peppercorns and bay leaves. Boil for 30 minutes, or until the meat is tender.</li>
            <li>Remove the meat from the pot and let it cool down for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 tablespoon of salt on the pork belly, distributing it evenly over all sections.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a separate cooking pot for deep frying.</li>
            <li>Carefully add each piece of boiled pork belly to the hot oil. Fry until crispy. Turn the meat over to fry the other side until crispy as well. **Note:** Be extra careful of oil splatters. You can use a pot cover to shield yourself, but leave a small opening to prevent steam buildup which can cause more splattering.</li>
            <li>Remove the cooked pork belly from the pot and arrange on a wire rack to cool.</li>
            <li>Slice the pork belly according to your desired serving sizes.</li>
            <li>Serve with lechon sauce. Share and enjoy!</li>
